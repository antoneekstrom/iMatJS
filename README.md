# iMatJS - Fictional online grocery store for the elderly

During a course I took at university we were designing a grocery store application.
Unfortunately, this program had to be made using JavaFX which made the whole process rather difficult.
Therefore, I now feel the need to prove to myself that I can actually make a decent program.
I am expecting this application to be substantially better in every way imaginable, and to take a fraction of the time to create.

This application aims to be similar to the original iMat in scope and design.
I am using the same design documents we made during the course. I also recreated the "backend" to function similarily,
though I did make some modifications in order for it to better work with Javascript and React.
